# MultiplayerFPSTeamProject

This Project cannot be publicly uploaded but for information on the project see my portfolio for details.

Here: https://marknicholsondev.github.io/fps-team-project

The reason for this is due to a PS4 renderer developed for the project meaning that it uses the Sony SDK which isn't allowed
to be publically available. 
- I may upload a version of the project without that renderer included however for now refer to the portfolio.
